I have created new director by this command 'mkdir' named 'test-dir' in Main Mac directroy, in Yaser directory of my Mac And then navigate to that directory and clone it with github https link which I copied from github website.
I have navigated to test-dir by giving this command in my mac terminal 'cd test-dir' and the navigate to the directory by typing this command, 'cd travelapp'. travel app is the name of our repository in git hub.

'git status' can be typed in out terminal by checking if we did any ammendments to the file like this README.md.

So this command 'git diff README.md' can be used to check chnages in the files. 

--This command 'git add README.md' can be used to make changes in the files saved. (We have stagged this file) 

This command 'git commit -m "This is uptodte commands for GIT updates to be used in staging"' can be used to commit 

-- Use this command, 'git push origin main' or we can use 'git push master main' depends on our github. We need to check in gihub and code section to see which branch is we need to push. thias push command is used to push to git hub from our computer.

In the same way we use, this command 'git log --oneline' to check the status of our git.
