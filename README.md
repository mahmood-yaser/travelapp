# travelapp
Picture travel app

2nd edition


On my MacBook,  I have created new directory by this command 'mkdir' named 'test-dir' in Main Mac directroy, in Yaser directory of my Mac And then navigate to that directory and clone it with github https link which I copied from github website.

-HTTPS link can be taking from git hub website by navigating to the directory and then click on code. Then in the code tab click on it and then copy https link like this:

https://github.com/mahmood-yaser/travelapp.git

I have navigated to test-dir by giving this command in my mac terminal 'cd test-dir' and the navigate to the directory by typing this command, 'cd travelapp'. travel app is the name of our repository in git hub.

'git status' can be typed in out terminal by checking if we did any ammendments to the file like this README.md.

So this command 'git diff README.md' can be used to check chnages in the files. 

--This command 'git add README.md' can be used to make changes in the files saved. (We have stagged this file) 

This command 'git commit -m "This is uptodte commands for GIT updates to be used in staging"' can be used to commit 

-- Use this command, 'git push origin main' or we can use 'git push master main' depends on our github. We need to check in gihub and code section to see which branch is we need to push. This push command is used to push to git hub from our computer.
-Older repositories called master and newer called main.

In the same way we use, this command 'git log --oneline' to check the status of our git.
